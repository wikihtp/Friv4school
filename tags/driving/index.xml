      <description>Pizza Delivery Lockdown is a simulation game about delivering pizza around town. During the Coronavirus, all cities are quarantined and at this time all city streets are free of cars and pedestrians. But still someone has to deliver pizza, because people are sitting at home and cannot go out into the city and go shopping on their own. Pizza delivery is a necessity in today&amp;rsquo;s world where people spend a lot of money to deliver good pizza right to their doorstep.</description>
